# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>>
The most important distinction between a list and a tuple is that a tuple is not mutable and a list is mutable.
Because dictionary keys must be immutable, in certain situation you can use tuples as dictionary keys. However, list can never be used as keys in
dictionaries. The list data structure has several methods tuples do not. Most notably list have the append, extend, remove, and pop.

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>>
A list keeps order and set do not, when you care about order you have to use a list. Sets and lists are similar in that they both just contain values. This is different
than a dictionary that use the key value system. Sets requires items to be hashable, list do not, if you have non-hashable items you cannot use set and must instead use list.
Sets forbid duplicates, list does not. Checking for membership of a value in a set (or dict, for keys) is much faster (taking about a constant, short time), while in a list it takes
time proportional to the list's length in the average and worst cases. The difference is sets are hashable while list are not.

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.
